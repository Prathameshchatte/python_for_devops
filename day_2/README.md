Welcome to python for DevOps Day-2 
In day 2 I have learned about data structure and algorithms:

data-structure : something that can hold data

There are two types of data structures in python 
    1. Primitive   2. Non-primitive

Primitive data types includes :
    1. integer (int) 2. float 3.string (str) 4.boolean (bool)

Non-primitive data types also has two types :
    1. Linear  2. Non-linear

        1.linear data type has: 
            1.list  2.tuple  3.set  4.dictionaries
        2. Non-linear data type has :
            1.linked list 2. graphs 3. tree 


**1. Lists:**
   - Ordered collections of items, changeable after creation.
   - Can hold different data types (numbers, strings, etc.).
   - Accessed using indexes (starting from 0).
   - Example: `shopping_list = ["bread", "milk", "eggs"]`

**2. Tuples:**
   - Ordered collections, but immutable (can't be changed after creation).
   - Used for fixed data that shouldn't be modified.
   - Example: `coordinates = (40.7484, -73.9857)`

**3. Sets:**
   - Unordered collections of unique elements.
   - Used for membership testing and removing duplicates.
   - Example: `unique_letters = {"a", "b", "c", "a"}` (stores only "a", "b", "c")

**4. Dictionaries:**
   - Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
   - Use keys (like labels) to access values quickly.
   - Example: `phonebook = {"Alice": "123-456-7890", "Bob": "987-654-3210"}`

**Choosing the right data structure:**

- Consider the following factors when selecting a data structure:
   - **Order:** Do you need to maintain the order of elements?
   - **Mutability:** Do you need to modify the data after creation?
   - **Uniqueness:** Do you need to ensure no duplicate elements?
   - **Access patterns:** How will you access the data (by index, key, etc.)?
